              Hi. Welcome! This website is going to visually summarize my works conducted in four different workshops, Coding, Screen, Making, and Playing, through level 1, semester 2 of Computation in Design class. In the Coding session, we(Nayeon, Sena, and Jiarong) chose to try the AR technique trial using some simple codings and Blender software to make the object. In the Screen part, I worked with Sena and Shalom. You can find out our interesting mini installation using special material, Flexi-glass.

              In the Making class, we had to make a real model of a polygon designed by coding. Lastly, in the Playing session, I teamed up with Sena and Shalom again and made an art craft using light circuits kit. Check out our thundering fluffy cloud.

            Pear and Hairband</h2>
            <p>
              We made objects using software called Blender. The first one is a pear-motivated character and the second object is a hairband rendered in glossy jiggly texture. It was my first time using the AR technique. Despite the level of coding, since this tech is our first time, we didn’t know what to research and were a bit afraid of starting this. Nevertheless, we slowed down the process then followed the lecturer’s instructions, and ended up successfully finishing the project.

              In the process,  so I had to modify the file format and viewer program to solve it because the rendered objects kept crashing, while my teammates made two cute objects using Blender.

            <h2>2 Screens<br />Projection Mapping</h2>
            <p>
              Teamed up in a group, we projected the mapped video to an installation made of Flexi-glass. Our video concept was unconsciousness of the brain, so we randomly collaged and blended the short footage like jellyfish swimming or a DJ playing music. According to the concept, we wanted a material that can express the cloudy, blurry feeling, so we chose the Flexi-glass inspired by artwork by Andreawolf ‘Six Memories’. We only built the cubes at first, but through the test project, we learned that those pieces reflect the light making a dreamy effect. Therefore, we added the pieces to randomly reflect the lights.

              Speaking of difficulties, standing the pieces in a stable position and cutting the material was quite hard. Mapping the videos into the screen with complicated coding was also challenging.

              Without my teammates, Sena and Shalom, I definitely would not have even started this project. They worked hard and tried to be creative which motivated me so much.

              This work represents the natural object, the sea acorn. The shape varies according to which plane you stick to each other. When I imagined the repetition of the random polyhedrons made by code, I came out with a bunch of sea acorns stuck on the surface of rocks. In fact, geometry in nature such as the Fibonacci sequence in seashells or spiral repetition in the pistil of sunflowers was easily found before. It’s interesting that the code, which is very mathematical, can visually configure the natural object.

              The process of visualizing data with paper crafting was very intuitive and direct. I could learn the randomness by looking at other classmates’ various shapes of outcomes.

              Our idea was to make a thundering cloud with crumpled transparent papers. In the beginning, we tried to make a unique origami shape like a herringbone pattern but since the light was too weak, we change the thickness of the paper. Then, folding so many times, the papers got crumpled and wrecked. In other words, our idea was not a part of the plan.

              Over the course of the semester, I have worked with different techniques, materials, and people. What I learned was an advantage of cooperating with team members. Compared to working individually, group work made me work harder and we could complement each other, also, the quality of outcome was better. Even though it is a bit of pressure to work in a group since I should not be a burden, I learned a lot.

              <b>What have I learned over the course of this semester?</b> I learned how to be more creative under instruction. For example, a memorable work was the building installation in the Playing class. When I read the instruction first, I only thought of using paper as material but we got to talk about concepts and tried to be creative in some way. Eventually, we chose the Flexi-glass which I never thought of. I learned that I can be more open, not just tied under instructions too much.

              <b>Some of my most interesting findings this semester are</b>: My most interesting findings this semester were that I tried different techniques. In the Coding session, I learned AR, also the Arduino drawing machine. In the Mapping, I found out how to make artwork by using coded graphics and projection. In the Making and Playing part, I learned data visualization by papercraft and a circuit kit.

              <b>What are some of my achievements?</b> My achievement is that I tried something I’ve never done before. For example, I was always thinking of AR(augmented reality) technique as something new, and difficult, so I didn’t know that I can try that. I know that it was instructed easily, but I felt like I achieved it because I finished it by modifying some small technical problems, and searching for the problems.
